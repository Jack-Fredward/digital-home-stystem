This is a list of assumptions made through out the developement process.

1. The oven sim will not be super realistic
    a. However it will work in large temp changes in small increments of time just to show that it works
2. The AC/Heat system temp sensors will be set to "room temp" upon initialization of a room
3. All temp simming will rely on previous seconds value. The kitchen.py class will only update based on the provided delta t. It is up to the simulation of the room to handle what t is.
